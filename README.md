# CPU-Scheduling-System
The CPU Scheduling System is a JavaScript-based project that simulates fundamental CPU scheduling algorithms used in Operating Systems. It allows users to input process details such as Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority, and then computes performance metrics like Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, and their averages.
