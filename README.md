## 🎯 Features
- Implements **FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin** algorithms.  
- Accepts process details: **Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority**.  
- Calculates:  
  - Waiting Time (WT)  
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)  
  - Average Waiting and Turnaround Time  
- **Gantt Chart visualization** for process execution.  
- Interactive interface for experimenting with scheduling.
